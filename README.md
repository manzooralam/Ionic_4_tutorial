FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) is an excellent way to keep our users engaged with our app,
and it also helps them by notifying them of important things that are happening.

#Step 1:
Create New Ionic Application
``` 
$ionic start project_name template_name
```
Step 2:
#Install the Cordova and Ionic Native plugins

``` 
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-fcm-with-dependecy-updated
npm install @ionic-native/fcm
```

Step 3:
#Now go into your app.module.ts file and import FCM and add it to the providers array:
```
import { FCM } from '@ionic-native/fcm';

@NgModule({
   
  providers: [
     FCM  
   ],
})
```

Step 4 :

#Register project to firebase console and get api key and google-services.json file:

Like this
<img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/includes/media/notification-hubs-enable-firebase-cloud-messaging/specify-package-name-fcm-settings.png">

and download the google-services.json file

Step 5:
#Updating package name inside ionic project:

 inside-> config.xml
 
 Step 6: 
#Past google-services.json file:

inside the 
 platform -> android folder
 
 Step 7: 
#Open your app.component.ts file and import the FCM plugin

```
import { FCM } from '@ionic-native/fcm';
//Inject it into the constructor:
constructor( public fcm: FCM ) {}

this.fcm.getToken().then(token => {
    backend.registerToken(token);
});

//Receiving push notification data
this.fcm.onNotification().subscribe(data => {
  if(data.wasTapped){
  
    //true , means the user tapped the notification from the notification tray and thatâ€™s how he opened the app.
    console.log("Received in background");
    
  } 
  else {
  
     // false , means that the app was in the foreground (meaning the user was inside the app at that moment)
    console.log("Received in foreground");
  };
});

this.fcm.onTokenRefresh().subscribe(token => {
  backend.registerToken(token);
});


```
